### IntelTBB_project
This is project from Advanced Programing course that I had during my fifth semester.
I was obligated to create a seminar about library Intel Threading Building Blocks.

The repository contains two folders:

Sem - Folder contains multimedial presentation and folder Przyk≈Çady with examples that I used during seminar.

Proj - Folder contains 3 exercises with solutions and, that I created fot students. They had to do them after my presentation as a homework and practice.

Every example and exercise have makefile.
