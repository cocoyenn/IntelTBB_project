# IntelTBB_project
This is project from Advanced Programing course that I have during my fifth semester.
I was obligated to create a seminary about library Intel Threading Building Blocks.

The repository contains two folders:
Sem - contains multimedial presentation and folder Przyk≈Çady with examples that I used during seminary.
Proj - contains 3 exercises with solutions and, that I created fot students. They had to do them after my presentation as a homework and practice.

Every example and exercise have makefile.
